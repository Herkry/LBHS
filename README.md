# Location Based Healthcare System
This is a geolocation-based doctor appointment web-based system that enables patients book doctor appointments.
Patients can search and filter doctors based on proximity of health centre, length of patient queue and mode of transport. They then book an appointment after which they are placed on the patient queue. The directions and estimated time information to the destination is also availed to them.
The doctor is able to view their past patient history and assign them a prescription which the patient will view on their end of the application.
The application was developed using Bootstrap 4, Javascript, MySQL and PHP.
Google Maps Web APIs which were used include Directions API, Distance Matrix API and Places API.
